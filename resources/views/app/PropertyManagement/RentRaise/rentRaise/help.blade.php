                      <p>You can add a tenant to the pending rent raise list by:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Changing the new rent amount (the <i>Rnt</i> column), which would be the new monthly amount that the tenant will start paying once the rent raise goes into <b>effect</b></li>
                        <li>By change the raise percentage (the <i>Rs%</i> column), which is the percentage difference between the new monthly rent amount that the tenant will pay and the <b>current</b> monthly rent the tenant is paying.</li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Note:</b> Everytime a pending rent raise is changed, the <i>notice period</i> and <i>effective date</i> (when the rent raise goes into effect for the tenant), is calculated and shown.
                            <br />
                            This calculation is a function of:

                              <li>The percentage difference or change in the tenant's rent applied over a 12 month period</li>
                              <li>The property type of the unit that the tenant occupies (Mobile Homes always receive a 90 day notice for a rent increase)</li>
                              <li>If need be, you can notice the <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i> dropdown menu to manually adjust the notice period along with the effective date of the rent increase</li>

The <i>amount</i> field should correspond to the past rent raise's amount and the <i>start date</i> correspond to the past rent raise's effective date. Changing either of those or deleting the billing item should then reflect in the rent raise entries for that tenant.</p>
